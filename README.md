# Introduction
### Nullnian
*This is based on personal practice about the leetcode problem solution code.*

The code is about the Leetcode_solution
The code is based on the Java and Python programming languages.
There are two branches: one for the solutions based on Python, and the other for the solutions based on Java.

# Patterns
## Arrays & Hashing
### Hashmap  
[key,value]  
**Use:** No need to maintain array order  

**New hashmap:**  
    ``` Map<Integer, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>(); ```  
**Find item:**   
    ``` hashmap.containsKey(key); ```  
**Add item:**  
    ``` hashmap.put(key, value); ```  
**Get value of key:**  
    ```hashmap.get(key);```
